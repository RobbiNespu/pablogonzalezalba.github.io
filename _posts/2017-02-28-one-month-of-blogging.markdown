I've been blogging daily all this month. Let's see what I've learned.

## Some data

- Consecutive days: 28 (Since today is the 28th, I'll count from Jan 31st to Feb 27th)
- Total words written: 13085
- Average words per post: 454.72
- Median words per post: 464
- Time to write a post: between 40 minutes and 2 hours

## Some thoughts

It was really hard to do it, but also very satisfying. I love the consistency that I got, doing something productive every day feels energizing. I'll definitely continue writing, even if I skip a day or two.

Here are some issues I've encountered and how I plan to fix them:

#### Not knowing what to write

The hardest part and [something I already wrote about]({% post_url 2017-02-17-how-to-choose-what-to-write %}). I'm still adding some ideas, but the midnight limit makes me skip many subjects because I know I won't be able to finish a post about them in time. Also having a busy weekend means an unplanned week and that's even worse.

#### Short posts

Post over the average amount of words feel small and concise, but complete enough to describe a simple subject. Posts shorter than that seem incomplete. For example [the post where I recommend Mosh]({% post_url 2017-02-08-great-tools-mosh %}) has enough content, I think, to encourage you to try it out, however it should also have installation/usage instructions. And others like [the tweet with IFTTT]({% post_url 2017-02-12-automatically-tweet-your-posts-with-ifttt %}) should be just an extra step in a bigger post.

#### Disconnected posts

A combination of the previous issues: information that should be together end up in small separated posts. I've tried to [solve it]({% post_url 2017-02-14-jekyll-create-a-page-for-a-tag-and-its-posts %}) and I think it's a great step, but they could be better integrated.

#### No time

Some times I just have no time, if I have a dinner or concert after work in a weekday, it means having to rush home and rush type a post that later has a bad feeling. Also the self-forced midnight limit prevents me of writing late. And I'm taking a 2 week long holiday soon.

## Future

I think the main problem behind those issues is that while I've been consistently writing and researching for more than an hour a day, I was forced to follow an arbitrary deadline. I could reap the benefits of daily working/writing while producing a better output with the following change:

#### Instead of writing *and* publishing each day, I'll write every day and publish when it's done.

The only issue with this new process is that's easier to fall off the wagon, I have nothing forcing me to do anything at all. But I like the feeling of completeness after a great post and I believe that will be enough to encourage myself to continue.

Also [Project: Checkers]({{ site.url }}/tag/project-checkers) seems very interesting and I'll have a lot of material to write about it.

So join me, not tomorrow, but soon, for more, and hopefully better, content.
