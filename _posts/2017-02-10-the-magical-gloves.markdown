This is probably my favorite story ever, it involves injustice, work ethic and gaming the system.

## Working at the winery

When I was younger I worked for a about a year in a mom-and-pop winery. It involved suggesting wines to the customers, stocking and cleaning the displays, changing 300 kg barrels of olives and moving many, many boxes of wine. For 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. There were two main rush hours and some off-peak times.

I have very good memories of my time there, I liked my coworkers, bosses, even some customers. I got my job there thanks to a very good friend, Nicolás, the protagonist of this story.

## Bad performance review

Since it was a heavy workload, we tried to get a small break any time it was possible. The bosses were quite friendly and understanding, as long as there were no customers unattended on rush hour and enough product stocked the rest of the day, they didn't complain. However they disliked seeing you sitting down, and Nicolás got caught twice.

It didn't help that he was a little naive. While he was (and still is) very smart, he believed almost everything we told him, so we played a couple of jokes on him. We played jokes on everyone, and he played along fine, but the ones involving him were a little more obvious[^1].

So one of the bosses started thinking that he wasn't working hard enough and talked to him, implying that either he started working harder or he would be fired.

## The only people who don’t make mistakes are the ones who aren’t doing anything

Obviously, he got worried and started doing everything to prove that he was actually a good employee. He went and proactively talked with all the customers going into the winery, handling 2 or 3 customers at the same time. On off-peak times he stocked everything by himself. He cleaned bottle by bottle all of our enormous displays.

He was handling everything. My rush hours started feeling very light, I got to take longer breaks and, if there weren't any customers, I wouldn't have anything to do. That's when I got called into the boss' office. I thought that I was getting the same talk Nicolás had.

I got a praise for my good work.

That was the most unexpected meeting I ever had. I couldn't comprehend how I was being praised for doing nothing. It took me a while until I understood.

As you can guess from the title, since he was the only one working, he was the only one that could make mistakes. He was talking with 80% of the customers, he had a high chance of being in the way of any random crazy ones that love to complain about anything. He was cleaning so many hundreds of bottles, that he dropped a couple. I'm talking of 2-3 dollars the bottle, and it was something that happened almost daily, but now it only happened to him. And there were more examples that I can't remember.

## Something changed

He got an ultimatum. But he knew he was working harder than everyone else. He told me he knew he was going to get fired, there was no way to get out of that.

The days passed, we continued to work but didn't talk as much as before. One day I was thinking about how it seemed that there were more people coming in than usual and I got screamed at: "Hey Pablo! What are you doing standing still? Go and stock some wines!".

While walking around with boxes and boxes of wine, I realized it. Nicolás wasn't working anymore. But wait, that couldn't be true. I just saw him going from the 1st deposit to the 5th back and forth a couple of times. It was just more people and more work to do.

A couple of days later and things seemed wrong. I just had my hundredth customer of the day, and I asked Nicolás how many he had helped. "Just 3. And then the boss congratulated me on getting back on track.".

## The Magical Gloves

He told me his secret: he put in the ["magical" work gloves]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/work_gloves.jpg) after clocking in and didn't take them off until closing time. That was it. There was a little of walking around, from deposit to deposit, always in front of everyone. He tried carrying around an empty wine box, but it was unnecessary, the gloves were enough.

He never said no to any request. But even when he wasn't doing anything and saying he could help, having the gloves on meant he would be dismissed and another poor soul[^2] would be called.

He couldn't do anything wrong and it seemed like he was working hard full time. It was so simple it was genius, it had to be too good to be true. So I decided to test it too.

During the next week I was having long conversations with Nicolás while waiting for some work to be assigned to us. I was living the magic, finally I understood what it was like to be Harry Potter.

## Nothing lasts forever

It was less than a month from the first day I put on the gloves until the day the magic stopped. We don't know what happened, but one day we got told to stop wearing gloves while talking with customers or in the main hall.

But in the end everything got better, Nicolás got the praises that he deserved and he worked there for a couple more of years.

## The moral of the story

Don't work, just pretend to do so. Wait, that feels wrong.

You can't win without magical artifacts. Scratch that, I was thinking about RPGs.

Oh, yeah, the moral is not for employees, it's for employers! Evaluating employees is hard and any measure you implement can be gamed.

I don't have a solution for this. But I hope this opens your eyes about how a bad implemented measurement could mean praises for people that game the system and blames for the honest working people.
