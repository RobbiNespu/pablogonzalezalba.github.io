A couple of weeks ago I got a really nice present: a [dry-erase notebook](http://www.phinotes.com/en/) (each page works like a whiteboard, I love it). With it came a Staedtler correctable Lumocolor® pen.

I'm going to show you a picture of it, can you see the design fail that this, otherwise awesome, pen has?

## The small fail

Honestly, the problem is quite small. It almost doesn't affect my diary use and, when it does, it's just a second or two inconvenience. My main issue with it is that there is a better design that doesn't have this problem and it's readily available[^1].

Have you discovered the difference yet?

Look at the placement of the eraser.

The pen has the eraser in the main body at the opposite side of the writing tip. So when it's uncapped, it works flawlessly. But what do we do usually with caps? We put them in the other side of the pen, so we don't lose them. This one seems to be designed that way, because it fits (although 99% of pens with detachable caps allow them to be placed in the other end). But now we can't erase!

So we are forced to either take the cap off and put it on again every time we erase, or to leave it around in the desk for our cats to play and lose it forever[^3]. Can you image a better way to do it?

## The better design

Here is a different type of pen[^2] that implements this improved design:

Putting the eraser in the cap is genius. When the tip is capped, you can erase with both of the pens. But when you place the cap in the end of the pen, as almost everyone does when they want to write, this pen still allows you to erase.

I'm not aware of the design process that goes to develop a pen, it's probably really complicated and has evolved a lot since the first pen ever made[^4]. However, for some companies, at least, it can still be improved upon.

[^2]: It took me a surprisingly large amount of time to find another kind of erasable pen, they aren't as common as I imagined.
