I'm starting a new project, a React Native Android game of Checkers/Draughts.

## A new project

It seems like I have too much free time[^1], I wanted to do something interesting and I've been interested on trying [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for a while.

As I mentioned when wrote about [making a Tetris game]({% post_url 2017-02-04-programming-for-fun-making-a-tetris-game %}), when making something in a new environment/language, starting with something that you know helps you concentrate in the new stuff.

Although I've played checkers since I was a kid, I've recently discovered that there are [more than 20 variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts#National_and_regional_variants), so that adds a little more spice to the situation and allows for more features to be added later.

## The process

This will be my first Android[^2] app and I'll be blogging about the whole process, from the initial design, coding, graphics to publishing to the store.

The starting point of this idea were these notes on my [erasable notebook]({% post_url 2017-02-05-design-fail %}):
![Checkers]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/checkers_notebook.jpg)

So expect many follow ups on this project and let's hope we learn a lot from the tasks we are going to engage.
