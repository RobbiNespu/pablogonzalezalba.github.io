If you want people to share (or not share) your content, you need to define what license applies to your posts. Not defining a license means that standard copyright laws apply, and those aren't very share-friendly.

## How to choose

[Choosealicense.com](choosealicense.com) is an amazing tool to help you decide.

Do note that if you have code and non-code alike (like in this blog) you should choose different licenses for each. For example, look at the footer of this page to check the one I choose.
