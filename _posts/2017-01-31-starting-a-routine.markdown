I've decided to stick to a routine to write more.

### **Just to write**

Nothing more, nothing less. Everyday I'll sit in front of my PC and write something. It doesn't have to be much, or any at all. But I'm going to open Sublime[^1] and see what happens.

I have a couple of drafts there, I'll create more, I'll publish one of them, I'll just create a new post, I'll write about not knowing what to write about, whatever. Hopefully this will help me become better at writing.

They won't be all full fledged posts, but small, interesting[^2] tidbits to share. I have tons of insights that I've learned and I've written in a text file somewhere in order to not forget about them. I could just as easy write them into my blog and, maybe, someone will find them useful too.

### Footnotes

[^1]: There are better editors probably, but I feel really comfortable with this one.
[^2]: No guarantees.
