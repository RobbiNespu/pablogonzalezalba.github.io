A way to increase traffic to your blog is to share your posts on Twitter. And there is a way to do it automatically.

## IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) (If This Then That) is an useful application to connect different services and make them do something after an event. For example, muting your phone when you arrive at work[^1], replicate your photos from Facebook into other social media, receive an email if there is going to rain, and many more that you can [discover](https://ifttt.com/discover).

For this particular case, we just need to do 6 easy steps:

1. Log in or create an account at [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com).
2. [Create](https://ifttt.com/create) a new Applet.
3. Select `Feed/New feed item` for the trigger.
4. Put your feed URL (this is automatically generated by Jekyll, usually it's your blog address + `/feed.xml`).
5. Select `Twitter/Post a tweet` for the action, it will ask for Twitter permissions.
6. Edit the tweet text if needed, but the default title plus URL is usually good enough.

You're done! Please remember that it may take a while since you post in the blog until the tweet is sent.

Now you don't have to worry about forgetting to tweet about it. And the same steps can be done for any other social media that you use.
