Writing is not always easy, specially if you don't know what to write about. This is what I do to try to write daily.

## Collect all the ideas, all the time

I believe it's very important to write down everything you consider, even the most vague or extreme ideas, otherwise you risk forgetting about them. Also as you write them you can see if there are connections or patterns, mixing vague ideas to conceive something concrete.

Ideas appear and disappear all the time, I usually get them while I'm doing something else, not always related. But if I think about "doing something" in the future, I also try to connect that to "writing about doing something". For example I wrote about [generating post from the command line]({% post_url 2017-02-02-generating-posts-from-the-command-line %}) because the previous day I was writing some post and I thought it would be nice to create a script, so immediately added writing about it to my list of ideas.

Sometimes I get ideas when I'm not at home, for example I was at work explaining [fzf]({% post_url 2017-02-07-great-tools-fzf-command-line-fuzzy-finder %}) to a colleague when I thought about writing that post. In that case, I'll quickly write a reminder about it in Google Inbox and snooze it for later, and when I get home, I copy all ideas from there to my notebook.

Here's my notebook[^1] where I collect ideas, some ideas are more developed so they are marked with a dot (‚óè):

## Planning future posts

I takes me anything from 20 minutes to a little over 2 hours to write a post, but most times I've already done some research on the subject before starting. As you can imagine, some post require more work than others and, also, some days I have more free time than others. For that reason it's also important to plan ahead.

On the weekends, I write longer posts, do some research for future posts, think about which days I won't have much time and I try to plan a post per day. If I know I'll have an hour or less, I'll choose an easy topic and do all the required research so I just need to write a couple of paragraphs. I also like to have one of those easy topics ready, in case of unforeseen delays.

When I sit to write, I usually know what the topic is (or have a couple to choose from) and I've done, at least, some research, so I can quickly be immersed in the subject to complete the post.

Some times the planning fails and the subject requires more research than I have time to do, so I have to change it and write about something else. And other times I just don't feel like writing about that idea at the moment.

## In the end, just write

If I want to enhance my writing and communication skills, I have to keep using them, that's why I keep a system that helps me to keep improving. I only write a post a day, but I've been trying to do it every day. And I'd rather write about something I'm, at least, a little interested.

I've been writing a lot about blogging because I've just came back to it, also about day-to-day tech because that also affects how I blog. However I also wrote about my [favorite story]({% post_url 2017-02-10-the-magical-gloves %}) and other random things that wander into my mind.

And I'll continue to do it, so expect more posts soon[^2].
