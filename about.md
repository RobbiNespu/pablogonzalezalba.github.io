I lived 13 years in Bariloche where I learned to love the cold and the snow. Another 13 in Buenos Aires because I love big cities. Now I have moved to Amsterdam to continue my personal growth in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

## Programming

I was absorbed in an online game on 2000, so I started looking at PHP tutorials trying to learn how to make a game like that. I paired with a friend and made a couple of small games. And then learned the importance of backups the hard way ðŸ˜‰.

However I liked it so much that I chose to study Computer Science in the University of Buenos Aires. And I've been developing software professionally for over 7 years.

## MTG

When I was starting high school, I became hooked up with this cardboard crack called Magic: The Gathering. Since then I have "quited" it a couple of times because of college and work, but I'll always come back because it's the best game ever. You can find me in MOL as *chimenea* (that's also my real life nickname when it's about Magic).

## Cats

I really love cats. I don't ever get tired of seeing them everywhere on the Internet, in the streets or, since I adopted Lorelei, in my home. If I go to friend's and they have a cat, I'll probably spend more time with the cat than with them ðŸ˜¸.

## Future

I like working somewhere that I care about. Where I can help making something that matters. If you think we could work together, let's talk!

## TL;DR
I love software development, Magic: The Gathering and cats. Does anything sound interesting? Contact me!
